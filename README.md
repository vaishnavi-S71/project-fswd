## About Quora for Engineering students

QES is a question and answer website for Engineering students. We tend to create a flagship
site similar to the Stack Overflow Site of the Stack Exchange Network, created in 2008 by Jeff
Atwood and Joel Spolsky. QES features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in
Engineering. Our notion of a better-connected engineering community to tackle all kinds of
academic and non Academical questions and problems would make the engineering
community better. Establishing a community-based platform like this would help bypass the
location barrier for Engineering students.
